        <h2>What is Crisislab?</h2>
        <h3>CRISiSLab, situated at Massey University's Joint Centre for Disaster Research in Wellington, is a state-of-the-art facility bridging technology and human behavior research. 
            The lab offers cutting-edge resources for experiments, simulations, and technology testing, while fostering collaboration between researchers and students in crisis management exploration. 
            Its skilled team focuses on AI, big data, decision systems, warnings, telecommunications, and user behavior. 
            CRISiSLab welcomes partnerships with like-minded individuals and researchers to innovate solutions for crisis management challenges.</h3>
        <h4>About 2023</h4>
        <h5>During the inaugural session, an overview of Crisislab's historical background and prior undertakings was provided. 
            This was followed by an introduction to the proficient Core Team specializing in Seismology, who elucidated the fundamental aspects of tsunamis, encompassing their origins, causal factors, and detection methodologies. 
            Furthermore, the session included insights from past laureates, who shared their valuable experiences, subsequently acquainting us with the intricacies of the ongoing project. 
            A practical illustration of the sensor's operational mechanism was also presented, highlighting its ability to discern and visually represent tsunami-related data through graphical representation.</h5>
        <h6>How The XStream Team has Accomplished this</h6>
        <h7>A waterproofed sensor is affixed to a 3D-printed weighted platform positioned at the tank's base. 
            A qwiic cable, originating from the sensor, traverses through a 3D-printed buoy, extending beyond the tank to connect with the main board. 
            As the sensor is traversed by a passing wave, it registers an escalation in pressure. By leveraging this pressure data, the program computes an approximate wave height. 
            Upon reaching a predetermined threshold indicative of a potential tsunami threat, an alert tone is activated and an automated notification is dispatched via WhatsApp. 
            This adaptable system can readily be replicated in practical scenarios by substituting WhatsApp with an appropriate emergency notification framework.</h7>
